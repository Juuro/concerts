One says it came from former guitarist Tim, who often said “ok, danke” or “ok, danke tschüss” when he made a mistake while practicing. In another version, told by the band themselves, the name was born while swimming together in the blue Adriatic Sea. They claimed that, with a bit of imagination, their moles seemed to spell out “okdanketschüss” when they put them side by side. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/ok.danke.tsch%C3%BCss\">Read more on Last.fm</a>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2389689280","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
